# Gap_statistics
Gap-Statistics was introduced by Robert Tibshirani in the year 2000 at Stanford. Determining the ideal number of clusters in a dataset is one of the key tasks in the clustering exercise. After the elbow method gap-statistics is one of the most prominent ones used. The basic idea is to compute the goodness of clustering measure based on average dispersion compared to a reference distribution for an increasing number of clusters.
